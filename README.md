# Spacewings
Spacewings is a - currently in progress - spaceshooter which should be about exploding spaceships, earning a crapload of money to make your ship a beast and destroy even more some of those bad guys to have even more cash then you have some weird ship insanely powerful so you're getting bored and it's not funny anymore and you stop the game.

There should be biomes, bases, AI, loots, trade in bases, ships upgrades ...

# Required
If you think you're too stronk to download the .jar and you should build Spacewings by yourself, all you need is obviously a JDK and Gradle.

# Building and running
```
  gradle desktop:dist
  java -jar desktop/build/libs/desktop-1.0.jar
```
